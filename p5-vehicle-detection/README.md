# Vehicle Detection
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video, but the main output or product we want you to create is a detailed writeup of the project.  Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/rykeenan/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup.  

Creating a great writeup:
---
A great writeup should include the rubric points as well as your description of how you addressed each point.  You should include a detailed description of the code used in each step (with line-number references and code snippets where necessary), and links to other supporting documents or external references.  You should include images in your writeup to demonstrate how your code works with examples.  

All that said, please be concise!  We're not looking for you to write a book here, just a brief description of how you passed each rubric point, and references to the relevant code :). 

You can submit your writeup in markdown or use another method and submit a pdf instead.

The Project
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

Here are links to the labeled data for [vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles.zip) and [non-vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles.zip) examples to train your classifier.  These example images come from a combination of the [GTI vehicle image database](http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html), the [KITTI vision benchmark suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/), and examples extracted from the project video itself.   You are welcome and encouraged to take advantage of the recently released [Udacity labeled dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations) to augment your training data.  

Some example images for testing your pipeline on single frames are located in the `test_images` folder.  To help the reviewer examine your work, please save examples of the output from each stage of your pipeline in the folder called `ouput_images`, and include them in your writeup for the project by describing what each image shows.    The video called `project_video.mp4` is the video your pipeline should work well on.  

**As an optional challenge** Once you have a working pipeline for vehicle detection, add in your lane-finding algorithm from the last project to do simultaneous lane-finding and vehicle detection!

**If you're feeling ambitious** (also totally optional though), don't stop there!  We encourage you to go out and take video of your own, and show us how you would implement this project on a new video!

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Extract HOG features from the training images.


1. Read in all `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.
Here are two example images, the first from the `vehicle` class and the second from the `non-vehicle` class:

![Vehicle](vehicles/GTI_Far/image0000.png)
![Non-vehicle](non-vehicles/Extras/extra1.png)

2. Use `skimage.feature.hog(training_image, [parameters=parameter_values])` to extract HOG features and HOG visualisation.
    * Wrapped in function `get_hog_features`.
    
Code in second cell in Section 1.1 in `p5.ipynb`. Relevant functions:  `get_hog_features` and `extract_features`.

#### 2. Choose HOG parameters.

TODO: Change and add
I tried various combinations of parameters and...

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

Code in second cell in Section 1.2.

#### 3. Train a classifier using selected HOG features and colour features.

1. Format features using `np.vstack` and `StandardScaler()`.
2. Split data into shuffled training and test sets
3. Train linear SVM using `sklearn.svm.LinearSVC()`.

Data preprocessing Code in Section 1.2, classifier trained in Section 1.3.

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Implement a sliding window search.

1. Define windows to search using helper function `slide_window`.
    * Restricted search space to lower half of the image (altered value of variable `y_start_stop`) because cars only appear on the road and not in the sky.
    * Scales to search: TODO:
    * How much to overlap windows: TODO
2.  Implement sliding window search using helper function `search_windows`.
    * For each window, 
        * extract features for that window, 
        * scale extracted features to be fed to the classifier, 
        * predict whether the window contains a car using our trained Linear SVM classifier, 
        * and save the window if the classifier predicts there is a car in that window.

Code in Section 2.

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to try to minimize false positives and reliably detect cars?

* Measures to reliably detect cars in single images: I restricted the search space

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used blob detection in Sci-kit Image (Determinant of a Hessian [`skimage.feature.blob_doh()`](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/plot_blob.html) worked best for me) to identify individual blobs in the heatmap and then determined the extent of each blob using [`skimage.morphology.watershed()`](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/plot_watershed.html). I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap and bounding boxes overlaid on a frame of video:

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
