Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree project files and notes.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program which I started working on on 27 October, 2016.

The Self-Driving Car Engineer is an online certification intended to prepare students to become self-driving car engineers. The program was developed by Udacity in partnership with  Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, Otto, DiDi, BMW, McLaren and NextEv.

## Program Outline:
### Term 1: Deep Learning and Computer Vision

- Project 1: Finding Lane Lines (Intro to Computer Vision)
- Project 2: Traffic Sign Classifier (Deep Learning)
- Project 3: Behavioural Cloning (Deep Learning)
	- Train a car to drive in a 3D simulator using a deep neural network. 
	- Input data comprises steering angles and camera images captured by driving with a keyboard / mouse / joystick in the simulator.
- Project 4: Advanced Lane Lines (Computer Vision)
- Project 5: Vehicle Detection (Computer Vision)

- `deep-learning-notes-and-labs`: Notes on Deep Learning, Tensorflow and Keras
- `computer-vision-notes-and-labs`: Notes on Computer Vision


### Term 2: Sensor Fusion, Localisation and Control
- Sensor Fusion: Integrating different types of sensors.
- Localisation: 'Where relative to the world is a car?' Alignment of car, sensors to the map. 
- Control: Computer program that steers cars, wheels so as to meet an objective.

### Term 3: Path Planning, Controlling a Self-Driving Car
- Path Planning: Finding a sequence of steps in a maze (navigating cities, parking lots)
- Put your code in a self-driving car
