    "### Lesson outline:\n",
    "* More sophisticated process (model) that can estimate the turn rate of a vehicle\n",
    "* Go through how the Unscented Kalman Filter deals with this non-linear process model\n",
    "* Implement the UKF in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CTRV model (Constant Turn Rate and Velocity Magnitude Model)\n",
    "* Relaxes assumption of vehicle's constant velocity \n",
    "    * When vehicles are turning, they move slower. So EKF's predicted position would be outside of the circular path of the car.\n",
    "* Describe velocity using Speed (v) and yaw (psi) angle\n",
    "    * Vehicle moving in a straight line has a yaw rate (psi dot) of zero.\n",
    "* Prediction: find f, where $x_(k+1) = f(x_k, v_k)$.\n",
    "* Approach: Describe the change rates of the state x.\n",
    "* Assumes constant turn rate (yaw dot) and constant velocity.\n",

    "## Unscented Kalman Filter\n",
    "* Predict and update steps as before\n",
    "#### Unscented transformation\n",
    "* Recap: issue with nonlinear process or measurement models is that predicted state distribution is usually not normal.\n",
    "    * UKF goes on with normal distribution with same mean and variance as predicted distribution (an approximation\n",
    "* Solve using sigma points (representatives of the whole distribution)\n",
    "    * Transform individual points of the state space thorugh the non-linear function.\n",
    "    * Calculate mean and variance of the sigma points.\n",

    "* Choose sigma points\n",
