    "Three steps:\n",
    "* **Prediction**: Estimating what other vehicles on a road might do next\n",
    "* **Behaviour**: Decide what maneuver to do next given estimates from prediction\n",
    "* **Trajectory**: Select path to follow given chosen behaviour.\n",

    "## 1. Discrete Path Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Motivation: Worth learning about (1) conceptually and (2) practically because discretising the world makes it easier and computationally faster to solve path planning problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Motion Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Want to get from A to B.\n",
    "\n",
    "§§![](imgs/1.1.png)\n",
    "- Difficult because mechanics within the path, e.g. lane shifting, might be risky and so you might not choose the most direct path.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given: Map, Starting location, goal location, cost function,\n",
    "Find: minimum cost path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Varying cost functions, e.g.:\n",
    "- Count left turn + and move one step forward as one move vs only left turn on the spot as one move\n",
    "- Left turns may be more expensive than right turns (because of congestion or traffic rules)\n",

    "### 1.2 Path planning as a search problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Without uncertainty:\n",
    "- Find the shortest sequence of actions that leads robot from start state to end state\n",
